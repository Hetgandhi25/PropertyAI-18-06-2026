## Project Overview

Property Property CRM is a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform purpose-built for the real estate industry. It streamlines property listings, lead management, and agent-customer interactions. 

Its standout feature is **OpenClaw**, an integrated AI-powered WhatsApp bot. Built on top of local LLMs (Ollama/Qwen3), OpenClaw handles incoming WhatsApp inquiries, understands real estate context, schedules appointments, and autonomously converses with potential buyers, routing complex queries to human agents when necessary.

---

## Features

- **Automated WhatsApp AI (OpenClaw):** 24/7 conversational AI agent answering property inquiries via Meta Cloud API.
- **Property Management:** Complete CRUD for real estate listings, including location hierarchies (State -> City -> Area).
- **Lead & Customer Tracking:** End-to-end lifecycle tracking from new inquiry to closed deal.
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Automated scheduling between agents and customers.
- **Agent Dashboard:** Real-time metrics, analytics, and lead assignments.
- **Resilient Background Processing:** BullMQ & Redis queues ensure no webhook or AI generation request is lost during traffic spikes.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Distinct views and permissions for Admin and Agents.

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React 19 + Vite
- **Routing & State:** TanStack Router, TanStack Query
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4, Radix UI, ShadCN UI

## The Journey of a Single Message

1. **Front Door**: Customer messages on WhatsApp; Meta sends an instant webhook to our Express Backend.
2. **Authenticity Check**: The `Meta Signature Validator` cryptographically verifies the SHA-256 HMAC signature.
3. **Permanent Record**: The message is saved to PostgreSQL (`RECEIVED` status). Duplicates are rejected at the DB level.
4. **Task Queuing**: A lightweight task is placed in BullMQ (Redis), and an instant HTTP 200 OK is returned to Meta to prevent timeout retries.
5. **Distributed Locking**: A background worker acquires a temporary Redis lock for the customer's phone number, ensuring only one worker generates an AI reply for that customer at a time.
6. **Strict Ordering**: The `DB-Queue Drainer` ensures messages are processed sequentially based on DB timestamps.
7. **AI Orchestration**: The `OpenClaw` orchestrator builds the context (chat history, property DB lookups) and queries the AI model.
8. **Resilience**: The query passes through a `Circuit Breaker` that protects the system from DGX Spark/Ollama outages.
9. **Outbound Ledger**: Before sending, a `PENDING` record is written to the Outbound Ledger in Postgres.
10. **Delivery**: The reply is sent to the Meta WhatsApp Cloud API.
11. **Confirmation**: Meta responds with a message ID (`wamid`), updating the ledger to `SENT`. The Redis lock is released.
12. **Read Receipts**: Subsequent webhooks update the ledger sequentially to `DELIVERED` then `READ`.

## Database Overview

The system uses **PostgreSQL** structured via Prisma. Core entities include:
- `User` & `Agent`: Authentication and agent profiling.
- `Property`, `State`, `City`, `Area`: Real estate listings and location mapping.
- `Customer`, `Lead`, `Appointment`: CRM tracking and scheduling.
- `Conversation`, `Message`, `AISession`: WhatsApp AI chat history and session context.
- `WebhookEvent`, `OutboundMessage`: Resilient logging of Meta API interactions.

---

## API Documentation

The REST API exposes the following primary endpoints under `/api`:
- `/auth` - Login, registration, JWT token generation.
- `/properties` - CRUD operations for real estate listings.
- `/leads` - Lead tracking and status updates.
- `/customers` - Customer data management.
- `/dashboard` - Analytical metrics for the frontend UI.
- `/appointments` - Scheduling between agents and customers.
- `/conversations` & `/reviews` - Chat history and feedback.
- `/whatsapp/webhook` - Endpoint for Meta WhatsApp API integration.
- `/ai-bot` - Internal endpoints for AI session management.

*For detailed interactive documentation, run the server and navigate to the integrated Swagger/Postman collection (if configured).*

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20+)
- PostgreSQL (v15+)
- Redis Server (v7+)
- Ollama (running locally or on a remote machine)

### 1. Database & Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
# Setup Prisma
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
# In the root directory
npm install
```

### 3. Ollama Setup
Install Ollama and pull the required model (ensure it matches your `.env`):
```bash
ollama pull qwen3:latest
ollama serve
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in both the **root** (for frontend) and **backend/** directories.

**backend/.env**
```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=4000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/propertycrm
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_secure_secret_here
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_secure_secret_here

OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen3:latest

# Meta WhatsApp Cloud API
META_WA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_meta_token
META_WA_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_id
META_WA_VERIFY_TOKEN=your_verify_token
META_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret
```

---

## Deployment Guide

1. **Build the Applications:**
   ```bash
   # Build Frontend (Root)
   npm run build
   
   # Build Backend
   cd backend && npm run build
   ```

2. **Start Production Services (Using PM2):**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production pm2 start dist/server.js --name "property-api"
   NODE_ENV=production pm2 start dist/worker.js --name "property-worker"
   ```

3. **Docker (Optional):** Use the included `docker-compose.yml` to spin up Redis and PostgreSQL quickly.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Reverse Proxy:** Configure Nginx/Caddy to serve frontend static files from `dist/` and proxy `/api` requests to `localhost:4000`. SSL/TLS is strictly required by Meta for webhooks.

---

## Usage Examples

### Testing WhatsApp Integration locally
You can use the provided backend scripts to simulate webhook events without needing a live Meta connection:
```bash
cd backend
npm run build
node dist/scripts/test-whatsapp-integration.js
```
This pushes mock webhook events into the Redis queue, allowing you to test the AI worker's response generation.

---

## Security

- **Authentication:** Stateless JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for API access.
- **Data Integrity:** Meta webhook signatures are verified using `META_APP_SECRET` to ensure authenticity.
- **Helmet:** HTTP header security configurations are enabled.
- **Queue Security:** BullMQ dashboard is protected via Basic Auth.

---

## Scalability and Performance

- **Decoupled Workers:** AI generation can take 2-10 seconds. Webhooks are immediately acknowledged (200 OK) and offloaded to BullMQ workers to prevent API timeouts.
- **Connection Pooling:** Prisma utilizes connection pooling for optimal database performance.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** The stateless worker nodes can be scaled horizontally to handle high WhatsApp message throughput.

---

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] **Multi-Tenancy:** Allow multiple real estate agencies to use the same deployment with isolated data.
- [ ] **Multi-Modal AI:** Enable OpenClaw to analyze incoming images of properties.
- [ ] **Email Integration:** Sync AI-generated email drips for lead nurturing.
- [ ] **Voice Calls:** Integrate AI voice calling for automated follow-ups.
